24/11/2022, 20:09 - +91 97168 98919: Have you ever visualised how any model overfits or underfits the dataset?
Or are you confused to understand what is underfitting or overfitting?
Or how the overfitting model is a complex model and the underfitting model a simple model?
Or what is the Bias variance tradeoff?

This article will give you answer to the above questions, not just theoretically but also practically, and it will clear your doubt about overfitting, underfitting and bias-variance tradeoff.

04/12/2022, 19:08 - +91 92059 79486: Obviously no
04/12/2022, 19:10 - +91 81785 68253: If a get the similar response from a couple of more people then I'll have to drop it to the iNeuron team. I believe they will handle it maturely.
04/12/2022, 19:13 - +91 92059 79486: They will not do anything
04/12/2022, 19:13 - +91 92059 79486: Krish sir should teach

04/12/2022, 19:15 - +91 95813 88411: Agree Not sufficient

04/12/2022, 19:16 - +91 88478 94318: or take extra class

04/12/2022, 19:22 - +91 89995 47341: Hi komal from this side,

Just now I heard from Sahil that you too are facing a problem to understand the project.
So we should get united and drop a mail to Krish sir, sudhanshu sir...

Otherwise things won't change and it will be just a waste of our time. 
We can't compromise with our time at this stage.
What do you all say???
04/12/2022, 19:23 - +91 81785 68253: Agreed. And in case they don't listen(which i doubt will happen) I've got a workaround.

We can start flagging it over the emails and wait for a few days
04/12/2022, 19:24 - +91 86178 08574: The hands on being done correctly according to me, there should have been knowledge check or coding assignment after every session to improve the understanding
04/12/2022, 19:24 - +91 89995 47341: Yeah what we can do is rather than mailing individually
We can take all our e-mail IDs and send one mail..

They can ignore individuals mail but can't ignore group mail.
04/12/2022, 19:25 - +91 86178 08574: not being done correctly*
04/12/2022, 19:25 - +91 86178 08574: +1
04/12/2022, 19:25 - +91 92059 79486: Yes
04/12/2022, 19:26 - +91 92059 79486: He is better..
04/12/2022, 19:26 - +91 89995 47341: Tbh, there are still many who do have problems with sunny too.
04/12/2022, 19:27 - +91 99875 64492: lets drop a mail with same subject line
04/12/2022, 19:27 - Tarun Rao: When will they complete the project ?
04/12/2022, 19:27 - +91 89995 47341: We paid because Krish sir and sudhanshu sir were going to teach us. But now the scenario is quite different .
04/12/2022, 19:28 - +91 92059 79486: But he keeps explaining till we understand
04/12/2022, 19:28 - +91 99875 64492: Exactly that's what i am saying from last 3-4 weeks
04/12/2022, 19:28 - +91 79855 54980: He left ineuron
04/12/2022, 19:28 - +91 89995 47341: That's great
04/12/2022, 19:28 - +91 99875 64492: he was present yesterday
04/12/2022, 19:29 - +91 90042 57538: Even today also
04/12/2022, 19:29 - +91 81785 68253: Because of that reason we can't compromise with our learning. We understand that but can't really compromise
04/12/2022, 19:29 - +91 79855 54980: May be serving notice period 😐
04/12/2022, 19:30 - +91 79755 70668: Can we all raise this in the class time when Krish is there
04/12/2022, 19:30 - +91 97168 98919: That is sunny bhaveen chandra, who left iNeuron.
04/12/2022, 19:30 - +91 89995 47341: Sure definitely but he should look into that
Otherwise he easily ignores everything
04/12/2022, 19:30 - +91 79855 54980: When it comes to prectical topics they do like that .. 
Same will be done when it come with computer vision ... 
I have seen previous videos in deep learning course ...
04/12/2022, 19:31 - +91 79855 54980: Yes .. he left
04/12/2022, 19:31 - +91 92059 79486: <Media omitted>
04/12/2022, 19:32 - +91 79855 54980: This is LinkedIn page of sunny bhaveen Chandra
04/12/2022, 19:33 - +91 99875 64492: he is not present from start of the course, Sunny Savita teaches for this course sometimes
04/12/2022, 19:33 - +91 79855 54980: Sudhanshu and Krish .. only teach theoretical concepts .. when it comes to project and other things .. it get shifted to other mentors
04/12/2022, 19:34 - +91 89995 47341: Anyhow the sunny which is mentioned here is not in iNeuron now
04/12/2022, 19:34 - +91 79755 70668: Yes we can request like we are not able to understand , I think this approach may help us when we raise this to Krish. Krish can't take atleast   Sunny should take our session bcoz we are adjusted to his wavelength
04/12/2022, 19:34 - +91 88478 94318: somebody write mail, wnd and attach our consent for the problem
04/12/2022, 19:35 - +91 92059 79486: Acha
04/12/2022, 19:36 - +91 79855 54980: Yes
04/12/2022, 19:39 - +91 97168 98919: He would be teaching us AI and Deep learning.
04/12/2022, 19:40 - +91 89995 47341: Seriously?
04/12/2022, 19:41 - +60 11-2419 2738: 😄we are gone.
04/12/2022, 19:42 - +91 79855 54980: 🤣🤣 he left the institute bro
04/12/2022, 19:42 - +91 90042 57538: I think code wise we are able to understand, maybe because he fumbled while talking most of us are facing issue but I think if we re-watch few more time it's good to understand, I'm also facing issue while remembering all steps...like how many file we need to create and components and all things...but for this things I don't they will change the mentor...this is what I think
04/12/2022, 19:42 - +91 88478 94318: happily 😀
04/12/2022, 19:44 - +91 89995 47341: How many times should we watch ???
04/12/2022, 19:44 - +91 92059 79486: They should provide some notes in a sequential manner where all the description about filles will be there so that we can read and understand
04/12/2022, 19:45 - +91 88478 94318: exactly my point
04/12/2022, 19:45 - +91 90042 57538: Yes we can ask for that
04/12/2022, 19:45 - +91 79855 54980: More importantly 
. 
In Deep learning .. ANN and CNN is entirely taken by sunny .. he left .. 
So don't know who will fill in
04/12/2022, 19:45 - +91 90042 57538: This is possible
04/12/2022, 19:45 - +91 90042 57538: But changing mentor I don't think...
04/12/2022, 19:45 - +91 88478 94318: Lets see what happens then we raise concern
04/12/2022, 19:46 - +91 88478 94318: btw who is writing the mail, please mention
04/12/2022, 19:46 - +91 88478 94318: this
04/12/2022, 19:46 - +91 88478 94318: atleast that will b handy, easy to take on
04/12/2022, 19:48 - +91 99875 64492: My suggestion is write a mail with same subject line to Krish and sudhanshu....
04/12/2022, 19:57 - +91 81785 68253: +1
04/12/2022, 19:58 - +91 98250 15084: +1  
Same subject and same messege
04/12/2022, 19:58 - +91 75880 03618: Yes
04/12/2022, 19:58 - +91 98250 15084: and this time when they send mail for live class feedback . 
at that time also . give then 1 stars
04/12/2022, 19:59 - +91 98250 15084: this will definately reach to there ears
04/12/2022, 20:01 - +60 11-2419 2738: Yes
04/12/2022, 20:03 - +91 95959 59773: As far concern Avnish,I think he is giving his 100%. He is hardcoding everything in modular way with MLOps.Initially I also find it difficult to understand because didn't practice OOPs and file handling.
04/12/2022, 20:04 - +60 11-2419 2738: File handling  Class date?
04/12/2022, 20:05 - +91 95959 59773: I will suggest go through CampusX channel for python and ML.You will definitely not find any difficulty in OOPs.
04/12/2022, 20:09 - +91 95959 59773: I didn't find it in dashboard right now. But it was there in one of session .
04/12/2022, 20:09 - +91 89995 47341: With huge respect to you aniket,
Just tell me one thing why we paid 17k to iNeuron???
04/12/2022, 20:09 - +91 81785 68253: See that's where the problem lies. With Sudhanshu, Krish and Sunny we didn't have to read anything extra. So now we have spare some extra time to understand what he explained in 3 hour long session
04/12/2022, 20:10 - +91 81785 68253: As soon as I'm dropping an email, I'll share the subject line here
04/12/2022, 20:10 - +91 89995 47341: Sure
04/12/2022, 20:11 - +60 11-2419 2738: Plz share subject line and mail body you write.
04/12/2022, 20:15 - +91 95959 59773: Guys they have taken theoretical concept and Avnish is taking practical concept which is kind of pro level with MLOps.We have to practice more.For MLOps lectures are there on dashboard.Go through it.
04/12/2022, 20:16 - +91 98250 15084: Aniket ..if you understand it.. then it fine.. 

Bt we have also paid.. 
And they should teach like everybody should understand..
04/12/2022, 20:16 - +91 98250 15084: It is not about 1-2 students..
04/12/2022, 20:16 - +91 98250 15084: Every student of may 2022 batch should understand..
04/12/2022, 20:17 - +91 98250 15084: And they should not go to next topic untill each and every student has the whole concept clear in mind.
04/12/2022, 20:17 - +91 90042 57538: What you are not understanding??
04/12/2022, 20:18 - +91 89995 47341: Exactly
04/12/2022, 20:18 - +91 98250 15084: Project part from day 2..
04/12/2022, 20:18 - +91 95959 59773: Guys it all about OOPs.Can we ask to take it again?
04/12/2022, 20:18 - +91 90042 57538: Coding wise?
04/12/2022, 20:19 - +91 98250 15084: Yes
04/12/2022, 20:19 - +91 95959 59773: https://youtu.be/Trvqq5w7-0Q
04/12/2022, 20:20 - +91 95959 59773: Go through this plyalist
04/12/2022, 20:21 - +91 95959 59773: It might help
04/12/2022, 20:21 - +91 95959 59773: This is free
04/12/2022, 20:21 - +44 7831 624309: It's 799/month if we have to enroll
04/12/2022, 20:22 - +91 95959 59773: If we need mentorship
04/12/2022, 20:23 - +91 95959 59773: Your all doubt related to Avnish coding will get resolved once you go through it.
04/12/2022, 21:05 - +91 79755 70668: Thank u Ankit.
04/12/2022, 21:11 - +91 81785 68253: What's the email ID of divyanshu and Krish can someone please share?
04/12/2022, 21:23 - +91 89995 47341: sudhanshu@ineuron.ai
krish.naik@ineuron.ai
04/12/2022, 21:40 - +91 81785 68253: Mail sent to them with subject line *"[Urgent] Concern regarding live classes"*
04/12/2022, 21:52 - +91 98250 15084: What is written in content.. ?
04/12/2022, 21:54 - +91 81785 68253: I just mentioned that I'm unable to understand whatever Avnish is explaining and the same is other's experience too. So they may let Sunny take the sessions
04/12/2022, 21:56 - +91 98250 15084: Okk.. 
I also send same mail
04/12/2022, 21:56 - +91 81785 68253: Perfect 👍🏻
04/12/2022, 22:14 - +91 90129 22002: But Avanish is project expert that's why he is taking classes, as told by Krish sir himself in the beginning of project. If sunny could, they wouldn't have call Avanish.
04/12/2022, 22:16 - +91 81785 68253: That might be but my job was to make them aware of the problem that I'm facing at first. I can have a discussion with them if they are up for it and accordingly come to a conclusion
04/12/2022, 22:18 - +91 90129 22002: You guys also want it to be industry standard. So I think it requires little extra effort. I am also facing the difficulty but i know only i need to pay more attention and put some more efforts
04/12/2022, 22:20 - +91 81785 68253: Industry standard? Sorry i didn't get that
04/12/2022, 22:21 - +91 79997 44064: +1
04/12/2022, 22:22 - +91 98250 15084: +1
04/12/2022, 22:22 - +91 90129 22002: This is just replication of real problem and when it comes to the real scenario things may be more complex and tougher. Why don't you start thinking like you are dealing with some real problem and you have to deal with it instead of blaming and other things
04/12/2022, 22:24 - +91 90129 22002: The level of work you have to do after joining
04/12/2022, 22:25 - +91 81785 68253: Makes sense but the question that i have for myself now is "Should i spend my time on these live classes anymore or not?". Because the expectations from the day 1 had been set that the content being delivered in these classes is sufficient enough and there is no need to go through anything else. So far things were going well, now it took a downturn from last week which is not justified according to me.
04/12/2022, 22:26 - +91 81785 68253: Before that we need to understand the basics. If I'm unable to understand the flow of execution, how can i build a project?
04/12/2022, 22:28 - +91 98250 15084: right
04/12/2022, 22:28 - +91 90129 22002: It will take time, so better to give yourself some time to digest these things
04/12/2022, 22:28 - +91 90042 57538: +1
04/12/2022, 22:30 - +91 90129 22002: Try to remember when you started learning python. Initially we didn't get anything but slowly our grip getting tighter and tighter
04/12/2022, 22:31 - +91 90129 22002: And when you go back after some time, then you realise how easy it was.
04/12/2022, 22:31 - +91 95952 53520: 90+ % people not understand Avnish code
04/12/2022, 22:32 - +91 90042 57538: No they are facing issue regarding to explanation
04/12/2022, 22:32 - +91 90042 57538: Few of them have problem with code
04/12/2022, 22:33 - +91 95952 53520: Yes.... Explanation
04/12/2022, 22:33 - +91 90129 22002: What if this is the reality of work you are going to do or what people expect you to do?
04/12/2022, 22:34 - +91 95959 59773: I will suggest go through the ML project session taken by Sudhanshu sir that are available on dashboard.
04/12/2022, 22:34 - +91 95959 59773: There is no excuse for hardwork
04/12/2022, 22:35 - +91 81785 68253: Initially i was able to understand things with great ease. Also we knew it that we were in the right hands. I've been watching Krish videos from a long time and that's where that trust was developed.

Speaking of giving more time, i honestly have less time for experimentations. Most of us are working and time is valuable for us.
Let's say 1 month down the line we could not understand anything at all. This 1 month of time will be go in vain.
04/12/2022, 22:36 - +91 81785 68253: Problem is with the explanation, not with the code i guess.
04/12/2022, 22:37 - +91 81785 68253: I think you currently are working in tech role? Please correct me if I'm wrong
04/12/2022, 22:39 - +91 90129 22002: I have gone through last year ml project recordings, only explanation was there code was written already.
04/12/2022, 22:40 - +91 81785 68253: That might help as i believe understanding the concept is more important
04/12/2022, 22:40 - +91 90129 22002: I think this is great opportunity for us to see how they use to write code.
04/12/2022, 22:40 - +91 90129 22002: No I'm student only
04/12/2022, 22:57 - +91 89995 47341 left
05/12/2022, 00:18 - +91 79855 54980: Just by seeing .. we might feel ok .. at that point but going ahead .. when v have to do it by ourselves.. we will get stuck
05/12/2022, 10:03 - +91 6280 963 446: https://youtu.be/MhWRwkrwJjY
05/12/2022, 22:00 - +91 98250 15084: <Media omitted>
05/12/2022, 22:00 - +91 98250 15084: My feedback of live class..
05/12/2022, 22:15 - +91 99397 90052: Yes it is true.
05/12/2022, 22:18 - +91 98182 66826: Totally Agree with this. Same feeling bro. Every working professional is short of spare time, very hard to manage work time, along with family and study things at the same time as they are going on.. Even I am now feeling cornered for the zeal of my transition.. till python, everything was going smooth and great. Starting ML, everything got mixed up..
05/12/2022, 22:25 - +91 99397 90052: We have to study prepared by our own then only it's helpful. Even in explaining/teaching also very very fast and hurriedly they want to finish if we learnt or not. This is what I am feeling and experiencing in ineuron sir.
05/12/2022, 22:27 - +91 98250 15084: Plz write all this in feedback form..
05/12/2022, 22:28 - +91 98182 66826: Y v hv paid. When we had to study by own. Courses available there at YouTube. Just watch and prepare urself. Please don't mind, take it in a healthy manner.
05/12/2022, 22:29 - +91 98182 66826: Not much difference than school then, it means. They also teach fast and in hurry and we have to prepare us by self
05/12/2022, 22:39 - +91 97168 98919: See, while constructing a building important thing is the foundation and pillars. Building the walls are other things are relatively easy, though time taking but are easy.  Foundation of python and ML is  been laid down by the Sudhanshu and Krish naik. Now rest of the things are easy and need to be done on our own. 

See, you need to come out of this mind makeup like every line of code needs to run and executed in front of you and when everyone understands then write another line of code. If this is the case then whats the use to invest 6 months in learning python code. And with this speed even a year would be less for you to complete the project. 

I am not advocating the iNeuron but things are not that difficult. 

Yes understanding the codes are difficult and for that you need to sit and watch.
05/12/2022, 22:46 - +91 97168 98919: See, first self study is key to success, eventually, you have to read on your own. If you are not doing self study, even 100 times krish will explain every thing still there are chances that will miss one or more concepts. 

If you have numbers from 1 to 100 in your course then whats the use going beyond 100. And you learn those numbers very fast then how can you say that are teaching very very fast. See they can go on repeating same concept 4 - 5 times in a class. Thats not feasible. 

So better do self study. Just my suggestion
05/12/2022, 22:48 - +91 99397 90052: Yes. That's what I have been following.
05/12/2022, 22:48 - +91 90042 57538: Follow what sunny sir told us in today's class

22/12/2022, 20:13 - +91 88478 94318: See iNeuron provided us a lifetime course material along with live classes, we cannot deny the fact.

Moreover, why are pre-assuming that there is no job guarantee for our batch?

We should focus on building our skills, as the recorded content is good on the provided cost, also not neglecting the fact that, many of us doesn't know basic things, as we depend on spoon feeding and depends on them
22/12/2022, 20:17 - +91 88478 94318: at the end of the day, everyone's target is good takeaway, so y dont they?
22/12/2022, 20:32 - +91 90218 58584: Yes we should truly be grateful for the quality and quantity of content we are getting from Ineuron for such affordable price. 

In April I had applied for internship at some company and they reverted back with a NLP assignment but that time l couldn't solve it as I didn't even have a programming background.
When l joined Ineuron l saw that same assignement project in the dashboard 
So l was glad that l came to the right place
22/12/2022, 20:33 - +91 88478 94318: Those who are joining today's class, take a clarification abt the job guarantee we'all are worried abt,
22/12/2022, 20:33 - +91 88478 94318: one shot all will be cleared
22/12/2022, 20:33 - +91 90218 58584: Do this as top priority guys thanks

Statistics
Basic excel 
EDA 
Power Bi / Tableau.. 

Storytelling
26/12/2022, 20:52 - +91 88904 56326: Okay do you have recommendation for statistic book
26/12/2022, 20:54 - +91 79855 54980: No.. 
But if u r from FSDS batch 
. Just go through the entire stats part from previous recorded sessions.. 
Or watch out the entire Krish playlist on YouTube on statistics.. that will be best to start with..
26/12/2022, 20:56 - +91 79855 54980: Also learn a gud amount of probability also ..
26/12/2022, 21:11 - +91 88904 56326: Okay
26/12/2022, 21:12 - +91 88904 56326: Thanks

27/12/2022, 03:10 - +91 90218 58584: 😂 we are getting IIT's course of data science for free
27/12/2022, 03:10 - +91 99397 90052: Yes definitely
27/12/2022, 03:14 - +91 99397 90052: With this(IIT Madrass statistics )  learning on power BI is very helpful. These two are very good combinations I found.

27/12/2022, 13:29 - +91 93719 83850: Using neurolab, the address localhost:portno will not work. Localhost needs to be replaced by your lab's url followed by port no. Something like this- url.ineuron.app:5000
27/12/2022, 13:32 - +91 92059 79486: Thanks bro. I will try this.

27/12/2022, 20:24 - +91 76088 83617: Correct the spelling 
apache-airflow
27/12/2022, 20:31 - +91 98111 07575: 🧐 much appreciated!! It worked..
27/12/2022, 23:10 - +91 81785 68253: Did anyone tuned hyper parameters of VotingClassifier using RandomSearchCV?
It may sound strange but It's not taking more than 10 key value pairs of parameters.
28/12/2022, 00:47 - +91 88478 94318: can you share screenshot for the same
28/12/2022, 00:49 - +91 81785 68253: It was throwing some ValueError without exact message. The moment i remove a few parameters, it worked fine. Ill share the screenshot tomorrow but that may not be helpful
28/12/2022, 00:51 - +91 88478 94318: okay, inbox me the ss
28/12/2022, 00:52 - +91 88478 94318: then we can discuss the same

28/12/2022, 09:52 - +91 93719 83850: Type extension is used to define data type annotations in python. It has nothing to do with parameter tuning. Also in line 8 and 9 you are reading CSV and doing profiling. You are not using type annotations here. You can delete imports at line 3,4,5.

28/12/2022, 18:35 - +91 99379 99162: Check space after dot
28/12/2022, 18:35 - Tarun Rao: space is not there
28/12/2022, 18:41 - Tarun Rao: so what should I do ?
28/12/2022, 18:44 - +91 99379 99162: Sorry I don't know.
 Once I was facing the same issue but it was resolved  by removing space.
28/12/2022, 18:45 - Tarun Rao: oh ok
28/12/2022, 18:48 - Tarun Rao: @919937999162 solved the problem

28/12/2022, 18:49 - Tarun Rao: I made spelling mistake
28/12/2022, 18:49 - Tarun Rao: instead of requirement I typed requirements

31/12/2022, 22:06 - +91 81785 68253: Have you checked user.email and user.name? Most likely this happens when these variables are not set
31/12/2022, 22:09 - +91 81785 68253: Did this happen with anyone that you created a new feature which has 15% correlation with output feature, yet it's not contributing in accuracy?

This seems strange to me. Any help in this regards is appreciated.

Happy New Year 😌
31/12/2022, 22:14 - +91 90042 57538: Both are correct I guess
31/12/2022, 22:16 - +91 81785 68253: Ummm not really what's wrong here. As far as i call recall, i came across probably the same error once. I reset the variables and it started working. Not sure if it's gonna work this time
31/12/2022, 23:02 - +91 93719 83850: Try to check if you are using https method or SSH method to authenticate. I think with SSH you need personal access token.

should be lifetime access for non subscription ones

06/01/2023, 21:59 - +91 81785 68253: Is there anyone from credit card industry or have some exposure of this industry?
I need some help related to a project.

Thanks already
06/01/2023, 22:13 - +91 92059 79486: Did any use apache airflow from AWS? I have deployed successfully but not able to open Airflow
06/01/2023, 22:14 - +91 92059 79486: I can't create larger machine.  Any solution will be highly highly appreciated
06/01/2023, 22:19 - +91 93719 83850: There is a way to run it locally but it needs a lot of configuration changes for docker image, authentication, etc. I am trying to do it but not there yet.
06/01/2023, 22:21 - +91 92059 79486: Okay bro I can't do lots of changes. I am still not confident with the project code. How they are opening by just changing the port and removing the secure connection
06/01/2023, 23:04 - +91 92059 79486: Do we need to create airflow account or we can use Avnish's account with the admin as username and password?
06/01/2023, 23:16 - +91 93719 83850: To run the airflow service, it needs to be configured with username, password and role. It has nothing to do with Avnish's credentials. Anyone with your EC2 app link and credentials can access admin panel. You can give whatever you like. Important is to not share with anyone.
06/01/2023, 23:19 - +91 92059 79486: Okay Bo. Thanks for the info. Understood now. Tell me one more thing why ec2app link is taking long tim eto open airflow and not opening many times? Is there any catch?
06/01/2023, 23:22 - +91 93719 83850: Only thing that I can think of is that, free tier ec2 instance is very slow and might be taking very long time to read data from db, process it and training. It might make session to expire. That's my assumption.
06/01/2023, 23:23 - +91 92059 79486: Yes that's why Avnish has created bigger machine. Is there any other way to test our application if we can not use bigger machince?
06/01/2023, 23:25 - +91 93719 83850: Yeah, that's what I said about running it on local.
06/01/2023, 23:26 - +91 93719 83850: Or may be try on azure with the credit you receive when logging it for the first time. You get 50usd I think.
06/01/2023, 23:26 - +91 92059 79486: Yes, Okay bro you try and please let me know if you succeed.
06/01/2023, 23:27 - +91 92059 79486: yes, I will try Azure once. Thank you
06/01/2023, 23:28 - +91 93719 83850: But it also needs same changes and alot of security settings to connect aws ECR with azure vm.
06/01/2023, 23:29 - +91 92059 79486: I need to study about deployment in depth then only I can make changes. There are lots of code.
07/01/2023, 01:19 - +91 93719 83850: you can run Airflow locally by installing Docker Desktop first. Then run this command to make a docker image on the local system - "docker build -t sensor ." Mind the dot after sensor(image name). It will take 30-45 min to build a docker image based on your computer specs. Once the image is done, run this command to start container - "docker run -dp 8080:8080 sensor".
07/01/2023, 01:20 - +91 93719 83850: It will atleast start airflow service & you can see the web app after login. But the pipelines will fail as it will not be able to store your model in S3 bucket.
07/01/2023, 01:23 - +91 93719 83850: to see the app browse to localhost:8080
07/01/2023, 01:24 - +91 88478 94318: Thanks, will give it a try now

08/01/2023, 21:42 - +91 96404 90672: Can anyone explain difference between  feature selection algorithms  and dimensionality reduction ??
08/01/2023, 21:44 - +91 92059 79486: Features selection: you will choose features. Features will remain same , for example just that you have chosen 3 out of 5 features 
Dimensionality reduction: features are getting transformed. Final components will not be the same as initial features.
08/01/2023, 21:45 - +91 92059 79486: Dimensionality reduction: you can't decide the features name because it is just transformed data
08/01/2023, 22:02 - +91 96404 90672: Okay
08/01/2023, 22:02 - +91 96404 90672: Thank you

18/01/2023, 20:00 - +91 92059 79486: Look at his explanation and Sunny's explanation for PCA. After paying also we didn't get his lecture in the course for PCA.  Sunny is good but Krish is the best. We have paid to learn from Krish not from others
18/01/2023, 20:05 - +91 99875 64492: Exactly but now nothing can happen......
18/01/2023, 20:32 - +91 88478 94318: irony is, it is open source 🥴
18/01/2023, 20:32 - +91 92059 79486: Ha that is different. I was just going through his lecture and feel like I should share my feelings here😂

21/01/2023, 11:31 - +91 79755 70668: Hi All, if Krish is not taking the class, and Sunny is going to take class then we should tell Sunny to revise any topic. Otherwise we are not oppose then DL will taken by Sunny itself.
21/01/2023, 11:32 - +91 79755 70668: I am not telling Sunny is bad but Krish is Super
21/01/2023, 11:32 - +91 79755 70668: We can make the difference PCA taught by Sunny and Krish
21/01/2023, 11:33 - +91 79755 70668: Plz let us know others view
21/01/2023, 11:37 - +91 98217 15290: I agree with you
21/01/2023, 11:37 - +91 98217 15290: Will ask sunny to revise previous topic
21/01/2023, 11:37 - +91 79855 54980: They will do as per there plan
21/01/2023, 11:38 - +91 98217 15290: Sunny said deep learning classes will be taken by krish sir only
21/01/2023, 11:38 - +91 79755 70668: But we can try.
21/01/2023, 11:38 - +91 79855 54980: Yed
21/01/2023, 11:38 - +91 79855 54980: Yes
21/01/2023, 11:40 - +91 95952 53520: Today Sunny sir will take practical implementation
21/01/2023, 12:40 - +91 98111 07575: pls confirm anyone able to login Internship portal to submit project ??

seems to be no longer available
21/01/2023, 12:51 - +91 98610 45001: Not logging in at all. Just checked
21/01/2023, 12:59 - +91 98111 07575: looks like it got disabled or under maintenance
21/01/2023, 13:58 - +91 88478 94318: yes
21/01/2023, 13:58 - +91 88478 94318: it is working fine
21/01/2023, 14:26 - +44 7831 624309: Personally speaking  it is their strategy to put Krish as the face and use Sunny or other junior members to run the lessons.....if you have noticed that when a complain was raised we see Krish showing up......i believe they have other courses running in parallel where Krish's presence is a must...now with PW also under their belt........I remember him answer the question like we have to give opportunity for Sunny to also grow.....I think that should be his problem not ours...(no grudge against Sunny, he's good but not as good as Krish is).......
Plus they also know that we are their strength too...and they are using us to give publicity via LinkedIn (is mutual as well but the immediate benefit is for them)......
Unless we all speak in unison we won't see any change that is for sure...else we should come to a mutual understanding with them on moving forward....

These were my thoughts going from long...I haven't commented on this topic yet....

Plus we must all have one this into our heads that is a business (a profit making business) and not a charity!!
21/01/2023, 14:30 - +44 7831 624309: *Plus we must all have one thing into our heads that iNeuron/PW is a profit making business model and not a charity organisation
21/01/2023, 14:32 - +44 7831 624309: I really got annoyed how Avnish got the lessons done...till then I was ok with Sunny's lessons too....and we will see more of different people too
21/01/2023, 14:35 - +91 86178 08574: I have kind of just given up expecting any quality from ineuron whatsoever, I'm just using this course to get the topics that need to be covered and then preparing by self using free resources and books available...Extensive self evaluation projects and tests should have been taken in this course, but they have rarely taken any, they just say vaguely to complete the tasks and submit assignments which I did not expect.
21/01/2023, 14:36 - +44 7831 624309: I'm kind of doing the same too...
21/01/2023, 14:37 - +91 86178 08574: Also since most of us are working its been very annoying to attend these long classes and not getting good takeaways
21/01/2023, 14:39 - +91 98250 15084: After these long classes also.. 
We have to refer from youtube or some other free source..
21/01/2023, 14:39 - +91 98250 15084: Whatever is taught by sunny in 4 hr.. is explained in 30min video of youtube..
21/01/2023, 14:39 - +91 92059 79486: This is more annoying. We get off on weekends only and not getting good takeaways since 2 months.  There is lots of difference between Sunny and Krish. Sunny doesn't know many concepts. He got stucked in the eigen values and eigen vector. I think we don't want these kind of teaching. We have paid for Krish and Sudhanshu
21/01/2023, 14:40 - +91 92059 79486: Exactly
21/01/2023, 14:40 - +91 92059 79486: Sunny stretch the session. What is the use of teaching pipeline in every class
21/01/2023, 14:41 - +91 86178 08574: Honestly sunny is not to be blamed here.. He's still learning and surely he has been asked by the ineuron team to take the classes, in krishs absence (and the other sunny that left)
21/01/2023, 14:41 - +91 98250 15084: Ya.. sunny cannot be blamed.. 
Bt what is our fault in all this..
21/01/2023, 14:42 - +91 98250 15084: Forget about the money.. 
Ineuron is wasting our precious time ..
21/01/2023, 14:42 - +91 92059 79486: No one is blaming Sunny. We are just saying the difference. I want Krish and Sudhanshu not Sunny. I think we also want the same
21/01/2023, 14:43 - +91 92059 79486: Obviously
21/01/2023, 14:43 - +91 98250 15084: Hmm
21/01/2023, 14:45 - +91 98250 15084: I m have spend my 3 days in learning PCA.. 
1st attended 4 hr lecture of sunny.. 
Then watch 2 hrs. old recording of sudhanshu.. 

And ultimately.. learn it from krish naik youtube channel.. 
Spending again 3 hrs
21/01/2023, 14:45 - +91 86178 08574: well once I'm done preparing myself, which is obviously going to take more time... I'll be leaving a detailed review on how the promises were made and how they were implemented.... Right now we just need to focus on learning and upsklling rather than wasting time...I had been following krish since a long time which made me enroll into this without any second thoughts
21/01/2023, 14:47 - +91 92059 79486: We will definitely learn in any way.
21/01/2023, 14:51 - +91 86178 08574: Watch couple of videos by 3blues1brown on matrix transformation and eingenvalue/eigenvector...that channel is a gem
21/01/2023, 14:52 - +91 98610 45001: Apart from 3,4 hour long lectures which is well covered in YouTube videos in 30 minutes I was really waiting for projects. But i am disappointed as we can't grasp everything in single live class video so we have to go through the recording video. But it is lagging. We should demand for another 2,3 projects in ML and that too from krish sir
21/01/2023, 14:58 - +91 99875 64492: That's what I was saying when I raised this issue when sunny started taking classes, but some people started opposing saying Sunny teaches well......but that's not the point, we have paid to learn from Krish and we have right to raise voice🙌🏻...
21/01/2023, 14:58 - +91 92059 79486: I do
21/01/2023, 15:00 - +91 95952 53520: Everyone paid for Krish sir & sudhanshu sir
21/01/2023, 15:00 - +91 98610 45001: Guys let us send email to krish and sudhanshu to teach atleast 2 more projects and that too from krish by sending email to

krish.naik@ineuron.ai,
sudhanshu@ineuron.ai,
21/01/2023, 15:01 - +44 7831 624309: That's their Marketing Strategy, Guys and we all fell for it!
21/01/2023, 15:01 - +91 95952 53520: Agreed
21/01/2023, 15:02 - +44 7831 624309: Someone mentioned about Sunny Bhavan Chandra who left iNeuron and has started his pay channel for consultation   everyone does it for Money....and we too are doing it for the same....
21/01/2023, 15:03 - +44 7831 624309: Their business model is more people less fee equals more profit
21/01/2023, 15:05 - +44 7831 624309: We can try complaining but don't think anything will happen Krish will come up with his standard motivational speech and we all end up doing it all ourselves......
21/01/2023, 15:05 - +91 98610 45001: Guys I am being honest that I don't have any issue about who teaches us as there are enough study material available on internet for making notes and preparing for interview. But my concern is for industry standard projects based on which interviewer will judge us. So they should teach us another 2,3 industry standard projects
21/01/2023, 15:06 - +91 88478 94318: +1
21/01/2023, 15:09 - +91 92059 79486: This is not possible. They even can't provide a proper notes where all the steps should e written. And you think they will teach again
21/01/2023, 15:10 - +91 98250 15084: Lets see what happen in today's lecture
21/01/2023, 15:11 - +91 90909 52427: Same here i also took 4 days
21/01/2023, 15:16 - +91 90909 52427: Right 
Avnish could have shared a PDF covering all the steps sequentially so that any one can refer and understand. But he didn't even share the whiteboard Notes in Resource properly
21/01/2023, 15:16 - +91 92059 79486: Even I have mailed them asked them in the doubt session a well
21/01/2023, 15:17 - +91 98250 15084: There doubt clearance team is of no use..
21/01/2023, 15:17 - +91 98250 15084: Till date.. 
They have not solved any of my doubts.
21/01/2023, 15:17 - +91 92059 79486: correct
21/01/2023, 15:18 - +91 90909 52427: Krish sir has said in 1 of the class that the amount/ quality of course material you are getting is more than enough wrt course fees paid. 17000/-
21/01/2023, 15:18 - +91 90909 52427: They tell to refer the recorded clips 😅
21/01/2023, 15:20 - +91 90909 52427: In those 5 hrs session. He writes some code in 1 file then suddenly goes to previous page to edit some variables. Too confusing to decode their coding strategy
21/01/2023, 15:20 - +91 90909 52427: It felt like Avnish was revising his coding skills in live lectute
21/01/2023, 15:22 - +91 98250 15084: Hmm today also..
I have asked many questions.. 
He has not given answer for any..
21/01/2023, 15:34 - +91 90909 52427: Chat support was good Initially
21/01/2023, 15:38 - +91 6280 963 446: Guys, just reading your all messages regarding projects
21/01/2023, 15:39 - +91 6280 963 446: Can you guys, please tell me some feedback so that I can upload more projects: https://youtu.be/uk2zMF6PA2I
21/01/2023, 15:41 - +91 90909 52427: I saw a video on your channel of ML.
You were quite writing all codes with proper explaination and clarity. 🙏🏻 Thanks
21/01/2023, 15:46 - +91 98610 45001: Your industry ready project playlist regarding insurance price is really good. It will be helpful if you add more such project playlist.
21/01/2023, 15:49 - +91 98610 45001: And it will be helpful if u provide little more explanation while coding the ingestion, validation etc pipelines
21/01/2023, 15:54 - +91 6280 963 446: Sure
21/01/2023, 16:03 - +91 82962 26281: Chutia hai sala ... Bhag raha hai
21/01/2023, 16:21 - +91 81785 68253: Is today's session going well?

21/01/2023, 17:13 - +91 81785 68253: If our linear regression model not over fitting, is there any need of Ridge/Lasso regression?
21/01/2023, 17:13 - +91 79755 70668: 170*11=1870
21/01/2023, 17:15 - +91 99875 64492: Ooh yes , it is 171 *10 assuming, but how 171, there should be no bias in input layer ryt
21/01/2023, 17:17 - +91 79755 70668: WHT I am guessing 170*10 input&HL1, Then adding HL2
21/01/2023, 17:17 - +91 79755 70668: 1700+10
21/01/2023, 17:17 - +91 99875 64492: This seems to be logical
21/01/2023, 17:18 - +91 99875 64492: But multiplication by 10 are neurons from hidden layer ryt
21/01/2023, 17:44 - +91 79755 70668: If anyone is there in the doubt clearing sessions plz ask this to Sunny

23/01/2023, 11:24 - +91 81785 68253: I honestly don't think this course is worth enrolling for. If you look closely at their curriculum you will realise they are not covering topics in depth. Take, for example, statistics.
23/01/2023, 12:05 - +91 90218 58584: I realised it's not good cause l looked for people who enrolled in this course on LinkedIn. Found very few.
23/01/2023, 12:12 - +91 81785 68253: Having least people enrolled in this course isn't really a red flag. The curriculum seems quite vague, doesn't have much topics to cover.

Plus, course fee is unreasonably high. Not sure if that industry experience will be delivered by an industry expert or what

01/02/2023, 16:55 - +91 76088 83617: *I have doubt*
Let’s say in your dataset you have a column called country and it has 185 unique categorical values. 

*How do you handle this ?*

My take :
As we can’t use one hot encoding here. 
One of the solutions I thought was to divide the country by  continent and then use one hot encoding 
But the flaw is that, what if this data is important like if we are predicting happiness level although India and Bangladesh are in same continent there happiness level will be different. 

Replace it with country gdp or country population 
What if these features already exists in the dataset.
What do you do ?
01/02/2023, 17:04 - +91 90218 58584: Calculating country's happiness level 🥲
01/02/2023, 17:09 - +91 76088 83617: ??

04/02/2023, 18:36 - +91 70237 56844: String type variable
04/02/2023, 18:36 - Tarun Rao: but we do not need to define the variable data type in python right then why :str ?
04/02/2023, 18:37 - +91 70237 56844: for other programmer to understand
04/02/2023, 18:38 - Tarun Rao: so not writing that wont have any impact on the program right?
04/02/2023, 18:39 - +91 70237 56844: right

04/02/2023, 21:22 - +91 98610 45001: Your emd to end industry standard project on insurance price prediction is very helpful. Please make more such complete end to end  projects.

04/02/2023, 21:56 - +91 90218 58584: I faced this problem when I was doing trading
04/02/2023, 22:00 - +91 6280 963 446: You have dataset
04/02/2023, 22:00 - +91 90218 58584: No
04/02/2023, 22:01 - +91 92059 79486: These are the problems which can be solved efficiently by the person who has finance related knowledge. I was also trying to make one project on portfolio management but everywhere s&p 500 are there no one has solved this kind of problem from nse
04/02/2023, 22:04 - +91 90218 58584: Okay
04/02/2023, 23:02 - +91 70206 63067: We can easily do that...to find least corrected stocks by using simple quants and we can use the API (from any stock broker to implement this)
I have been using this type of system in 2022. I wanted to make a 100% algo model..but it did not work at that point in time.
04/02/2023, 23:20 - +91 81785 68253: +1
05/02/2023, 11:37 - Tarun Rao: I have a doubt if I have __init__.py file in a python file of a folder then while importing the that file will all the functions and variables of the files be available to us ?

05/02/2023, 15:34 - +91 95952 53520: Aaj phir holiday hai 😃😅
05/02/2023, 15:38 - +91 95952 53520: Why krish sir is not taking class?
05/02/2023, 15:39 - +91 81785 68253: Can anyone please let me know once the doubt clearing starts? I'll join the session then
05/02/2023, 15:54 - +91 88478 94318: the other day, there was no doubt clearing
05/02/2023, 15:56 - +91 92059 79486: Aaj bhi nhi hoga
05/02/2023, 15:56 - +91 88478 94318: 🤣🤣
05/02/2023, 15:57 - +91 92059 79486: Wednesday & Friday ko doubt session hoga
05/02/2023, 15:58 - +91 81785 68253: Mujhe to bol rha h ki class k end me doubts lega mere
05/02/2023, 15:58 - +91 81785 68253: Dekhte h ab
05/02/2023, 16:00 - +91 88478 94318: <Media omitted>
05/02/2023, 16:01 - +91 81785 68253: Bhai rukna hi padega 🙆🏻‍♂️
05/02/2023, 16:03 - +91 90042 57538: Yes
05/02/2023, 16:04 - Tarun Rao: so we do not need to explicitly mention __init__ when we call lets say senor.utils.__init__ import blabla
05/02/2023, 16:05 - +91 81785 68253: No need to import it explicitly
05/02/2023, 16:06 - Tarun Rao: Okay
05/02/2023, 16:10 - +91 79755 70668: day by day it is becoming pathetic. Alteast krish should take care of DL.. it simply westing our time.
05/02/2023, 16:13 - +91 79755 70668: Hi All,  if you all are not happy then we can conpose email to Krish and Shudhansu mentioning all our names since induvisual email are not working, if every one aggre then we can think and try.. Then only they will think of it
05/02/2023, 16:13 - +91 95952 53520: Yes... Total waste of time
05/02/2023, 16:15 - +91 92059 79486: <Media omitted>
05/02/2023, 16:16 - +91 81785 68253: Sending emails individually may work, provided the language should be firm. Choosing the right words definitely works
05/02/2023, 16:17 - +91 92059 79486: na
05/02/2023, 16:17 - +91 92059 79486: yoputube, linkedin will work
05/02/2023, 16:17 - +91 92059 79486: Public ko batao
05/02/2023, 16:17 - +91 92059 79486: Otherwise maill willnot work
05/02/2023, 16:19 - +91 98250 15084: I agree.. comment on his youtube channel..
05/02/2023, 16:19 - +91 98250 15084: Comment on every latest video of krish naik
05/02/2023, 16:20 - +91 92059 79486: 153  participants are there. Let's take a survey how may of them are fine with classes
React thumb on this message if you are not okay with the classes
05/02/2023, 16:21 - +91 98677 16992: <Media omitted>
05/02/2023, 16:21 - +91 98677 16992: Very pathetic writing
05/02/2023, 16:22 - +91 79755 70668: you are righ untill unless we all oppose this will not work
05/02/2023, 16:24 - +91 92059 79486: Yup but first take what majority of the people wants. Only 6 reaction so far
05/02/2023, 16:25 - +91 90042 57538: Noo
05/02/2023, 16:26 - Tarun Rao: got it bro
05/02/2023, 16:28 - +91 99875 64492: Nothing is gonna work, unless and until a LinkedIn post with unsatisfied reviews are posted....then only they'll take us seriously 😅😅
05/02/2023, 16:30 - +91 81785 68253: That can be done as a last resort but till then we have to give another chance to them to rectify things asap. If they don't, then social media isn't going anywhere
05/02/2023, 16:30 - Tarun Rao: can anyone explain me the use of feature store folder in the project
05/02/2023, 16:30 - Tarun Rao: whats its use
05/02/2023, 16:30 - +91 99875 64492: Group members have mailed twice or thrice, no results 😓😓
05/02/2023, 16:33 - +91 92059 79486: tabtak tumhara course khatm ho jayega
05/02/2023, 16:33 - +91 81785 68253: Let me re-iterate this:

1. There's always a right way of doing things. Dropping emails with professional approach always leave an impact.
2. If it doesn't, we should confront them over the live session in front of all.
3. If it still doesn't work, then comes the social media post.

Let's take baby steps for now and give this team a chance
05/02/2023, 16:34 - +91 81785 68253: Utna wait ni karna, aaj mai bat kar rha hu. Agar solution na mile to social media wala option khula h. Withing next 1 week wo sab ho skta h
05/02/2023, 16:35 - +91 98250 15084: We should have done this.. 
When they have brought sunny to teach.. 

We are already late..
05/02/2023, 16:36 - +91 81785 68253: True, but better late than never
05/02/2023, 16:36 - +91 81785 68253: We still can do all this in a faster pace, putting pressure on the team
05/02/2023, 16:37 - +91 92059 79486: Do one thing, you write a proper mail and include all of our mail in CC
05/02/2023, 16:37 - +91 92059 79486: Atleast 100 mail id is needed
05/02/2023, 16:37 - +91 92059 79486: Okay
05/02/2023, 16:39 - +91 81785 68253: Why just one person? Why shouldn't they see the flood of emails rhyming together in their inboxes?
05/02/2023, 16:41 - +91 92059 79486: Because I and you will send the email along with us 7-8 log aur bhej denge but usse kuch nhi hoga. But if you keep all the members email in CC tab jake kuch hoga
05/02/2023, 16:42 - +91 92059 79486: See jabtak majority nhi chahega ki tutor change ho tab tak tum jitna email , msg kr lo nhi hone wala kuch
05/02/2023, 16:43 - +91 92059 79486: Maximum 10 log ko dikkat h.  I don't see much involvement from others
05/02/2023, 16:43 - +91 98250 15084: I m going to comment on the youtube video only..
05/02/2023, 16:43 - +91 98250 15084: That will strike directly to krish naik..
05/02/2023, 16:44 - +91 92059 79486: My point is one person can't do anything and they will not take our issue seriously agar humlog group Mai kuch nhi kiye tkh
05/02/2023, 16:44 - +91 92059 79486: Toh
05/02/2023, 16:44 - +91 81785 68253: Okay

05/02/2023, 18:19 - +44 7831 624309: The standard of teaching is on constant fall with each day moving forward. It feels like a genuine pig batch to test and train the teaching skills of junior teaching staff of iNeuron. I expect lessons from Krish Naik or other senior members to carry out the lessons so that it becomes fruitful and effective to students. Many times such concerns were raised but don't see any concrete resolution to this issue. Kindly request to iron out a permanent solution  to the student batch.
05/02/2023, 18:19 - +44 7831 624309: Done now!
05/02/2023, 19:56 - +91 81785 68253: So far I've received 14 responses only. Is there anyone else left?
05/02/2023, 20:01 - +91 98250 15084: Yes..
05/02/2023, 20:01 - +91 98250 15084: Wait for 1-2 days.. 
I will fill form when i reach home..
05/02/2023, 20:02 - +91 98250 15084: Wait for 1-2 days.. so that u get maximum responce.
05/02/2023, 20:16 - +44 7831 624309: 14/153 ??? So does that mean only these 14 ppl in   here are dumb heads???
05/02/2023, 20:16 - +91 92059 79486: 😭😭😭
05/02/2023, 20:17 - +91 81785 68253: Its hardly gonna take a minute to fill it up. Anyways, please try to fill it as earliest as possible
05/02/2023, 20:18 - +91 81785 68253: Its surprising to me also
05/02/2023, 20:18 - +91 90218 58584: Most people don't care
05/02/2023, 20:18 - +44 7831 624309: Only 14 ppl don't understand the lesson but majority do??
Then I think we should check with the majority as what approach do they take for success!!
05/02/2023, 20:19 - +91 81785 68253: Probably, or they are taking a lot of help from internet
05/02/2023, 20:20 - +91 90218 58584: Yes self study
05/02/2023, 20:20 - +91 81785 68253: Yeap we need to. But I'm sure I've given my best to understand what Avnish explained and now I'm regretting my decision of re-watching his videos. I should have not done that

Feeling like have thrown 16k in dustbin. The only attractiveness is Krish sir's session and Sudhanshu sir's initial python sessions. 
Really disappointed with iNeuron.
05/02/2023, 21:01 - +91 88478 94318: no , they maybe fearing...that, ineuron might be able to blacklist them, not call or shortlist them for placements 😂
05/02/2023, 21:01 - +91 88478 94318: so not filling out the forms
05/02/2023, 21:01 - +91 88478 94318: @918178568253 how many entries till now?

05/02/2023, 21:25 - +91 98250 15084: Hello Team ineuron, 
The standard of teaching by your teachers is constantly falling day by day. You are playing with our carriers by sending junior teachers to teach such important topics like Time series, Deep Learning... 
Krish Naik has all the time to upload videos on youtube. But he doesn't have time  to teach the students who have paid for the cource .. i simply dont understand how can a student(Boktiar Ahmed Bappy) teach us Deep Learning. i have lost interest in attending the sessions now.. you guys are wasting our precious time. 
I dont want to spoil reputation of ineuron. thats why saying all this in note .. we want krish naik to teach us Deep learning and all the remaining important topics .. 

If krish sir. will not come to take lectures .. then i will start telling the reality of ineuron to other students in social media platforms whether linkedin or youtube.. 

Really  disappointed with ineuron.

05/02/2023, 21:34 - +91 81785 68253: Its understood to them if we are not happy we will leave negative feedback on social media. You may edit your responses if you feel like, I've kept that option enabled
05/02/2023, 21:34 - +91 98250 15084: Nobody will hear in calm manner.. 

We have tried all this.. 
Sending mail to sunny and filling the ineuron feedback forms.. 

Nothing happened..
05/02/2023, 21:35 - +91 95959 59773: We can raise our voice in discord community
05/02/2023, 21:36 - +91 98250 15084: Target krish naik youtube channel.. only that will make impact.. nothing else..
05/02/2023, 21:36 - +91 98250 15084: Tarket that market.. from where there are getting students..
05/02/2023, 21:37 - +91 98250 15084: Negativity spreads faster then positivity
05/02/2023, 21:38 - +91 98250 15084: And dont be afraid of job gaurantee .. 

Ineuron is not capable to give any jobs.. 
If they can give jobs.. 
They sunny savita will not be teaching in ineuron since 2 years
05/02/2023, 21:40 - +91 90218 58584: I saw sunny bhaveen Chandra and sunny Savita's LinkedIn both them are now working in the same company from San Francisco

05/02/2023, 21:43 - +91 95959 59773: At least we can discuss issues with each other here

06/02/2023, 14:20 - +44 7831 624309: Also guys, I know this was discussed before.....the term Lifetime access mean lifetime of the company and not lifetime of the user!!!
06/02/2023, 14:21 - +44 7831 624309: So we might loose the access depending on iNeuron's future
06/02/2023, 14:22 - +91 89730 57401: They promised as lifetime access whenever joining this course. So, don't worry, you will get lifetime access!
06/02/2023, 14:25 - +91 89730 57401: focus more on job guarantee than course access! Nowadays you will get lot of resources on online. But, to get opportunity and upskilling skills is more important!
06/02/2023, 14:26 - +91 98610 45001: I think this is more relevant information
06/02/2023, 14:26 - +91 98610 45001: You won't get lifetime access if the company is dissolved after acquisition
06/02/2023, 14:27 - +91 98610 45001: This is true tho
06/02/2023, 14:47 - +91 81785 68253: A person aware of corporate laws might be able to confirm this, but looking at the quality of content we won't need lifetime access of it

08/02/2023, 20:46 - +91 98610 45001: May b they are from IT background or experienced I suppose
08/02/2023, 21:03 - +91 91619 50052: Or may be mostly lost their hope from ineuron dur to less interactive classes 😭

08/02/2023, 22:07 - +91 81785 68253: Will share the concern with the iNeuron team by EOD
08/02/2023, 22:08 - +91 92059 79486: After removing the outliers, it will be a balanced data😀
08/02/2023, 22:09 - +91 81785 68253: Don't go into that much of depth bro 🤣
08/02/2023, 22:39 - +91 98610 45001: Batch size is not 150. Only 150 students are added in this group. I think may b the batch size around 800 to 1000
08/02/2023, 22:39 - +91 70206 63067: Even more than that
08/02/2023, 22:56 - +91 98250 15084: Is their any reliable source of your data ?
08/02/2023, 22:56 - +91 98250 15084: That may batch will have 800-1000 students.. ?
08/02/2023, 23:00 - +91 98610 45001: When they were teaching mongoDB  , the url they provided for connecting with database  it showed around 600 hit on real time
08/02/2023, 23:01 - +91 98610 45001: Considering that 60,70% students are attending live class you can predict that the batch size is around 800 to 1000 may be

09/02/2023, 01:00 - +91 81785 68253: An ideal batch size sould be somewhere 100-250 max. Beyond this, managing a batch get a bit challenging specially on zoom
09/02/2023, 01:19 - +91 90218 58584: Thats 1 Cr per batch

09/02/2023, 09:29 - +91 92059 79486: I don't think so...you have to flatten the array
09/02/2023, 09:43 - Tarun Rao: No
09/02/2023, 09:43 - Tarun Rao: You definitely cannot pass a 1d array
09/02/2023, 09:46 - +91 92059 79486: ?
09/02/2023, 09:46 - +91 88478 94318: can you explain?
09/02/2023, 09:52 - +91 88478 94318: are you saying about the typical ML problem where we have several rows & columns (kinda a matrix --> 2D array) that is used for model training, you're talking about?
09/02/2023, 09:54 - Tarun Rao: yeah like csv is similar to matrix(2d array)
09/02/2023, 09:54 - Tarun Rao: I mean look you will pass x, y while fitting the model right ?
09/02/2023, 09:55 - Tarun Rao: generally you will pass a csv file as x and one feature as y (pd.Series)
09/02/2023, 09:55 - Tarun Rao: but in the project avnish was passing 2d array as x
09/02/2023, 09:56 - +91 88478 94318: I didn't see his video, can you please provide a ss /

09/02/2023, 17:26 - +91 92059 79486: I think you have to use comp data, try to get some baseline and use that new company. Aggreagate ratios using some mathematics or statistics
09/02/2023, 17:40 - +91 88478 94318: which one

28/02/2023, 09:11 - +91 88478 94318: yes
28/02/2023, 09:11 - Tarun Rao: because I have only used aws to deploy my project but I don't know complete aws as in I am not a cloud engineer
28/02/2023, 09:11 - +91 88478 94318: that is your project architecture, anyway u need to present, otherwise if u dont, there will be a gap created
28/02/2023, 09:12 - +91 88478 94318: just go through all the steps in aws & its corresponding learnings

06/03/2023, 17:56 - Tarun Rao: Guys after performing hyperparameter tuning my accuracy is reducing why is it reducing ?
06/03/2023, 17:59 - +91 99440 94955: Maybe earlier it was over fitting and now parameters are optimised to give equal weightage to all samples.
06/03/2023, 19:01 - Tarun Rao: I have used pca to reduce the number of columns and getting  79 % accuracy but if I use the full data set I get accuracy of 99.9% should I use PCA  ?
06/03/2023, 19:02 - +91 81785 68253: What's the training and testing accuracy?
06/03/2023, 19:02 - Tarun Rao: Similar
06/03/2023, 19:02 - Tarun Rao: Around testing accuracy
06/03/2023, 19:03 - +91 81785 68253: That means the model is close to perfect fit, in that case i wont recommend using PCA unless the number of dimensions are way too much
06/03/2023, 19:03 - Tarun Rao: 92 columns
06/03/2023, 19:03 - Tarun Rao: I have reduced it to 50
06/03/2023, 19:04 - +91 81785 68253: And number of rows?
06/03/2023, 19:04 - Tarun Rao: 30k approx
06/03/2023, 19:25 - Tarun Rao: Sorry 46 k records
06/03/2023, 19:47 - +91 81785 68253: I think it's fine without PCA
