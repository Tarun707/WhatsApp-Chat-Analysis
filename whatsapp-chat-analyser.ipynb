      "05/12/2022, 22:18 - +91 98182 66826: Totally Agree with this. Same feeling bro. Every working professional is short of spare time, very hard to manage work time, along with family and study things at the same time as they are going on.. Even I am now feeling cornered for the zeal of my transition.. till python, everything was going smooth and great. Starting ML, everything got mixed up..\n",
      "05/12/2022, 22:25 - +91 99397 90052: We have to study prepared by our own then only it's helpful. Even in explaining/teaching also very very fast and hurriedly they want to finish if we learnt or not. This is what I am feeling and experiencing in ineuron sir.\n",
      "05/12/2022, 22:27 - +91 98250 15084: Plz write all this in feedback form..\n",
      "05/12/2022, 22:28 - +91 98182 66826: Y v hv paid. When we had to study by own. Courses available there at YouTube. Just watch and prepare urself. Please don't mind, take it in a healthy manner.\n",
      "05/12/2022, 22:29 - +91 98182 66826: Not much difference than school then, it means. They also teach fast and in hurry and we have to prepare us by self\n",
      "05/12/2022, 22:39 - +91 97168 98919: See, while constructing a building important thing is the foundation and pillars. Building the walls are other things are relatively easy, though time taking but are easy.  Foundation of python and ML is  been laid down by the Sudhanshu and Krish naik. Now rest of the things are easy and need to be done on our own. \n",
      "\n",
      "See, you need to come out of this mind makeup like every line of code needs to run and executed in front of you and when everyone understands then write another line of code. If this is the case then whats the use to invest 6 months in learning python code. And with this speed even a year would be less for you to complete the project. \n",

      "Yes understanding the codes are difficult and for that you need to sit and watch.\n",
      "05/12/2022, 22:46 - +91 97168 98919: See, first self study is key to success, eventually, you have to read on your own. If you are not doing self study, even 100 times krish will explain every thing still there are chances that will miss one or more concepts. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you have numbers from 1 to 100 in your course then whats the use going beyond 100. And you learn those numbers very fast then how can you say that are teaching very very fast. See they can go on repeating same concept 4 - 5 times in a class. Thats not feasible. \n",

      "So better do self study. Just my suggestion\n",

Anyone with your EC2 app link and credentials can access admin panel. You can give whatever you like. Important is to not share with anyone.\n",

      "06/01/2023, 23:22 - +91 93719 83850: Only thing that I can think of is that, free tier ec2 instance is very slow and might be taking very long time to read data from db, process it and training. It might make session to expire. That's my assumption.\n",
      "06/01/2023, 23:23 - +91 92059 79486: Yes that's why Avnish has created bigger machine. Is there any other way to test our application if we can not use bigger machince?\n",

      "07/01/2023, 01:19 - +91 93719 83850: you can run Airflow locally by installing Docker Desktop first. Then run this command to make a docker image on the local system - \"docker build -t sensor .\" Mind the dot after sensor(image name). It will take 30-45 min to build a docker image based on your computer specs. Once the image is done, run this command to start container - \"docker run -dp 8080:8080 sensor\".\n",

Which is based on real-time stock price prediction. Which is a ML project and after completion of internship we can try use the same for DL. I've a complete planning for this project and open to listen your ideas also. I've successfully completed my first internship project \"Thyroid disease detection\" with understanding of the topics and end-to-end pipeline. Link: https://github.com/saisubhasish/ThyroidDetection_ML_Project  . I'm a working professional and I also have an experience of around 1.5 years in stock trading. So looking for teammates, who have interest in the equity market, we can join together to collaborate our ideas to make a better product. If you're interested kindly DM me. Thanks*\n",
